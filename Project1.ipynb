        "Since our dataset is rather small and splitting such a small dataset can result in potentially unreliable and inconsistent results, we will use K-Fold Cross Validation in an attempt to get a more reliable accuracy score based on the dataset. This ensures that the randomly chosen training and testing data does not so easily skew the results since in K-Fold Cross Validation the data is split K times such that in one split we are able to test on one set of data and in another split we are able to train on that same data.\n",

        "The model can perform well but only when tested against selected parts of the dataset. This is because the dataset is not sufficiently large enough to perform either adequate training or adequate testing. With a larger dataset the model could be further trained to find deeper correlations in the data and testing could retrieve more reliable results that are more indicative of the model's performance with future data."
